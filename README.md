# Genie: An Open-Source Portfolio Management Platform Inspired by BlackRock’s Aladdin

Genie is a robust, open-source portfolio management tool designed to replicate key functionalities of BlackRock's Aladdin platform. This project focuses on portfolio construction, risk assessment, and performance tracking, with a specific emphasis on managing currency-hedged ETF portfolios.

## Key Features

- **Portfolio Construction**: Create and manage diverse portfolios with various asset classes, including currency-hedged ETFs.
- **Risk Assessment**: Calculate essential risk metrics such as Value at Risk (VaR), Beta, and Sharpe Ratio to evaluate portfolio exposure.
- **Performance Tracking**: Track portfolio returns, compare against benchmarks, and perform attribution analysis to measure investment success.

## Project Goals

- **Technical Proficiency**: Demonstrate expertise in programming, data analysis, and financial modeling using Python and other open-source tools.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Showcase a deep understanding of portfolio management concepts, risk analysis techniques, and currency hedging strategies.
- **Aladdin Simulation**: Provide a hands-on demonstration of functionalities similar to those found in BlackRock’s Aladdin platform.
